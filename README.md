# book-finder

## Description

I wanted to create an application that will allow me to search my favorit books on a live webpage using Render. I wanted to test my ability using a full stack application with a front end in react, back in in Mongodb, Vite as my run time, an Apollo Server that uses GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API and Express.js server as middleware.
